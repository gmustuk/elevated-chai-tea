    <strong>AGE: </strong>30
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PROFESSION: </strong>Yoga Instructor

<p>
    <strong>Technology: </strong>Has a desktop computer at home, but mostly uses her iPhone to listen to music, post and browse on social media apps, and order things online.


<p>
    <strong>ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOURS: </strong>Values health and wellness as a top priority. Seeks out natural and organic products and willing to pay extra for high quality ingredients. The environment and sustainability is important, so she values products that have eco packaging that doesnt generate more waste. She is willing to spend time to prepare healthy fresh food and drink, as apposed to quick/fast food that might be unhealthy. Values time to write in her journal, think, read while enjoying a rich hot or cold drink. As a busy Yoga teacher she uses social media to connect and interact with her students, posting about upcoming events and photos from the yoga studio.

    <strong>FRUSTRATIONS AND NEEDS:  </strong> Maya loves the ritual of having a delicious cup of coffee in the morning, but feels wired from the caffeine and hates the crash later in the day. She wants to have a hot drink that is healthy and gives her some natural energy without the ill effects of drinking coffee. Teaching her students requires a lot of focused energy output and she needs to stay healthy and alert to be able to do what she does. When she gets sick it creates a lot more stress for her because she has to cancel and reschedule classes and loses income from not working. She wants a drink that also has other health benefits like immune boosting properties so she can stay healthy. Other healthy drinks she has tried like MUD\WTR doesn't taste very good and lacks the cozy and rich experience she likes with drinking a good cup of coffee at home or in a cafe.
