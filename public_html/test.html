        <h2 class="chai-intro">What is Masala Chai?</h2>
        <p>Masala chai is a spiced tea beverage that originated in India and has since become a beloved drink around the
            world. Traditionally, it's made by brewing black tea with a blend of aromatic spices, such as cinnamon,
            ginger, cardamom, and cloves, and then simmering it with milk and sweetener.</p>

        <p>But in recent years, Masala chai has undergone a makeover, with many people exploring its potential beyond
            the basic recipe. The addition of healing herbs and spices, such as turmeric, ashwagandha, and holy basil,
            have been touted for their numerous health benefits, including reducing inflammation, boosting immunity, and
            promoting relaxation. Raw cacao has also been added to create a rich, chocolaty flavor while providing
            antioxidants and magnesium.</p>

        <p>Functional mushrooms like reishi, chaga, and lion's mane have also been added to enhance the drink's
            benefits. These mushrooms are known for their adaptogenic properties, which help the body cope with stress
            and balance its natural processes.</p>

        <p>At our chai business, we take Masala chai to the next level by incorporating these expanded recipes of
            healing herbs, spices, raw cacao, and functional mushrooms into our blends. We believe that the combination
            of these ingredients not only makes our chai taste amazing, but also provides our customers with a unique
            and healthful experience that they can feel good about.</p>
